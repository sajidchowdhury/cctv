Task ID: S02
Agent: Z.ai Code (main)
Task: Session S02 — Database Schema, Prisma & Tenant Isolation. Land the full data model from doc §7 with tenant_id everywhere, soft deletes, UNIQUE(email) constraints, and a Prisma client extension that replicates PostgreSQL RLS on SQLite. Seed a dev tenant + owner. Verify cross-tenant isolation + 1-email-per-account at DB level.

Work Log:
- Read prior context: worklog.md (none — S01 didn't create one), dev.log (clean), git at commit 1609491 (S01).
- Read existing prisma/schema.prisma (only User + Post stubs), src/lib/db.ts, src/lib/tenant-context.ts (S01 stubs).
- Authored full prisma/schema.prisma: 24 business models + Tenant + reference tables (Category, Unit). Every business model carries tenant_id + created_at/updated_at/deleted_at. SQLite workarounds documented (no native enums → string+validation; no array column → serials as JSON string; money as Float).
- UNIQUE constraints: users.email (global), tenants.owner_email, plus tenant-scoped uniques (category names, unit names, invoice numbers, SKUs, RMAs, quotes, salary month).
- Indexes added on all hot query paths (tenant_id + date / status / party / product).
- Rewrote src/lib/tenant-context.ts with AsyncLocalStorage-based runWithTenant()/getTenantId()/requireTenantId() — per-request tenant scoping without global pollution.
- Rewrote src/lib/db.ts with a Prisma client extension ($extends) that auto-injects tenant_id on create/createMany and auto-filters findUnique/findFirst/findMany/count/aggregate/update/updateMany/delete/deleteMany. Added adminDb (raw client, no extension) for super-admin cross-tenant paths.
- Fixed 5 schema validation errors during db:push: (1) Quotation↔Sale 1:1 relation fields on both sides, (2) convertedSaleId needed @unique, (3) Product needed back-relation for QuotationItem, (4) SaleItem↔InventoryUnit 1:1 needed @unique + single owning side, (5) Unit.products back-relation + Product.unit relation naming conflict (dropped redundant denormalised String, kept relation).
- Removed deprecated previewFeatures=["clientExtensions"] flag (functionality is stable in Prisma 6).
- Wrote src/scripts/seed.ts: creates demo tenant (Dhaka CCTV Center), owner@cctv-demo.bd (OWNER role), UNLIMITED subscription (PENDING_ACTIVATION), 2 categories, 1 unit. Idempotent via upsert.
- Wrote src/scripts/verify-tenant-isolation.ts: 4 automated tests — (T1) tenant A findMany sees only A's products, (T2) tenant B can't fetch A's product, (T3) duplicate email rejected (P2002), (T4) create auto-injects tenantId from context.
- DEBUG: first verification run failed — extension hook wasn't filtering. Root cause: TENANT_SCOPED_MODELS set contained lowercase names ("product") but Prisma passes PascalCase model names ("Product"). Fixed casing in both TENANT_SCOPED_MODELS and SOFT_DELETE_MODELS sets.
- Cleaned orphan test data (reset DB), re-seeded, re-ran verification → ALL 4 TESTS PASS.
- Added db:seed and db:verify scripts to package.json.
- Lint: bun run lint clean (zero errors). Dev server: /api health check returns {db:"ok"}.

Stage Summary:
- Deliverables: prisma/schema.prisma (24 models, full doc §7 coverage), src/lib/db.ts (tenant-isolation Prisma extension + adminDb), src/lib/tenant-context.ts (AsyncLocalStorage tenant scoping), src/scripts/seed.ts, src/scripts/verify-tenant-isolation.ts, package.json scripts.
- Key decision: tenant isolation via Prisma client extension (auto-filter reads + auto-inject creates) replicates PostgreSQL RLS on SQLite. Production swap to Postgres = flip datasource provider + add RLS policies as defence-in-depth; the extension stays as a second guard.
- Acceptance: 3/3 criteria pass. Cross-tenant reads return empty. Duplicate email rejected at DB level (P2002). Schema matches every table in doc §7.
- Phase status: P0 Foundation now 2/5 sessions (S01 ✅, S02 ✅). Next: S03 — Auth, RBAC & 1-Email-Per-Account.
- Artifacts committed: schema.prisma, db.ts, tenant-context.ts, seed.ts, verify-tenant-isolation.ts, package.json scripts, updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
